![Latest CI/CD Action workflow](https://github.com/san99tiago/aws-whatsapp-chatbot/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

My Serverless WhatsApp chatbot on AWS, serving as a personal assistant with access to my private data.

## Architecture :memo:

<img src="assets/aws-whatsapp-chatbot.png" width=90%> <br>

How is the Generative-AI approach implemented on top of AWS?

- RAG on top of Bedrock Knowledge Bases leveraging an OpenSearch Serverless Vector DB from PDF files.
- Bedrock Agents to enable APIs and Database requests to fetch live data as part of the chain-of-thought process.
- State Machine for different workflow's processing based on the user's input (text, voice-message, etc).

## State Machine Process :fallen_leaf:

The processing of messages is powered by an AWS Step Function that has multiple tasks based on the user's input:

## Manual Steps (Only Once) :raised_hand:

### WhatsApp Configurations

These steps show the creation of the "Meta Projects" and settings that will allow us to use WhatsApp Business APIs:

### AWS Configurations

These steps show the creation of a Secret on AWS that will contain the required tokens/credentials for connecting AWS and Meta APIs.
